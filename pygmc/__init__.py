    Connect to device.

    If all parameters are None, _auto_connect() flow is used which attempts to connect
    to all available ports.
    If ANY parameter is given; it's used to refine the search, any matches are
    considered.
    Parameters are used as an OR search.

    Parameters
    ----------
    port : str | None, optional
        Exact port (device dev path / com port) e.g. '/dev/ttyUSB0'
        If port is specified, the following kwargs are ignored: vid, pid, description,
        hardware_id.
    baudrate: int | None
        Device baudrate. Leave None to auto-detect baudrate. Only applicable when port
        is specified.

    Raises
    ------
    ConnectionError
        Unable to connect to device.
