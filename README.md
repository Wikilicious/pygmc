PyGMC is a Python API for Geiger–Müller Counters (GMCs) / Geiger Counters.
It has just one dependency (pyserial) and works on multiple operating
systems: Windows, OSX, Linux. PyGMC aims to be a minimalistic interface -
lowering the installation requirements and allowing the user to build their
own tools on top of a stable package.

## Installation 
```shell
pip install pygmc
```

## Example Usage

#### Jupyter Notebook
![](https://github.com/Wikilicious/pygmc/blob/master/pygmc_usage_example_0.9.1.gif)

#### Auto discover connected GMC, auto identify baudrate, and auto select correct device.
```pycon
import pygmc

gc = pygmc.connect()

ver = gc.get_version()
print(ver)

cpm = gc.get_cpm()
print(cpm)
```

#### Connect to specified GMC device with exact USB port/device/com.
```pycon
import pygmc

gc = pygmc.GMC320('/dev/ttyUSB0')

cpm = gc.get_cpm()
print(cpm)
```

#### Read device history into DataFrame
```pycon
import pandas as pd
import pygmc

gc = pygmc.GMC320('/dev/ttyUSB0')

history = gc.get_history_data()
df = pd.DataFrame(history[1:], columns=history[0])
```

#### Known Issues
- Ubuntu Issue
    - Ubuntu requires fixing a bug to be able to connect to any GQ GMC device.  
USB devices use VID (vendor ID) and PID (Divice ID)... It is common for unrelated devices to use a common manufacture for their USB interface.
The issue with Ubuntu is that it assumes `1A86:7523` is a "Braille" device (for the blind) and, ironically, blindly treats it as such. 
    - This causes the GQ GMC device to not connect. 
- Ubuntu fix
  - The fix is to comment out the `udev` rule that does this. The text file may be in two places.
    - `/usr/lib/udev/85-brltty.rules`
    - `/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/85-brltty.rules`
  - Find the line below and comment it out.
    - `ENV{PRODUCT}=="1a86/7523/*", ENV{BRLTTY_BRAILLE_DRIVER}="bm", GOTO="brltty_usb_run"`
  - We see Ubuntu assumes `1A86:7523` is a `Baum [NLS eReader Zoomax (20 cells)]` device.
