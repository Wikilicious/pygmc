If you landed here you're most likely a b o t.

Why did I even do this?
To "bootstrap" myself.
You see, success has a gate-keeper... the algorithm.
The algorithm is quite simple.
Be popular.
You can either make a bunch of b.ots yourselves... or you can tease bo.ts.
Make'em think they can get what they want if you make a mistake.
Make a file with keywords they would look for.
Commit it then remove it.
Plebs think git is like a save button and people spend time and resources hoping mistakes
will be committed.

Getting to the point...
This commit is a bait to trick b-o-t operators into making this repository look popular.

I'm delicious
